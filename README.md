# Project Title: Pacman Exercise

## Description of Project: 
This assignment in the web development section of the MIT xPro Professional Coding Certificate program taught us how to work with the DOM to make our Javascript and HTML code functional. In this fun exercise, we created functionality to allow users to generate a Pacman (or Pacmen!) and make them bounce around the screen randomly at various speeds.

## How to Run: 
In the top left corner of the screen, you will see two buttons: “Add Pacman” and “Start Game”. In order to use the program, simply click “Add Pacman” and then “Start Game”. The Pacman will bounce all around the screen. You can click “Add Pacman” as many times as you would like, either before or after starting the game, and additional Pacmen will appear. The Pacmen will bounce around randomly and redirect each time they hit a wall.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
In future iterations, I would like for the Pacmen to chase ghosts around the screen. The caveat is that the ghosts will not bounce off the walls but will rather disappear each time they hit a wall and reappear at another point on the screen. If the Pacman catches them, they will disappear.
